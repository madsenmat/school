Well it looks like we are living longer with the years.... 

```{r}

p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd = 1, se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

And getting wealthier...Hot Damn... 

```{r}
q <- ggplot(subset(gapminder, country == 'Canada'),  aes (x = year, y = gdpPercap))

q + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd = 1, se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```


####How did Homework 1 go?

* **Issues:** 
 + Struggled for a bit with the chunks, but eventually figured it out  
 + Having trouble running install.packages(....) as I get an error when I try to run them in a markdown. 
 
>Quitting from lines 9-11 (hw01_gapminder.Rmd) 
Error in contrib.url(repos, "source") : 
  trying to use CRAN without setting a mirror
Calls: <Anonymous> ... withVisible -> eval -> eval -> install.packages -> contrib.url
Execution halted

_my code (originally at top, removed backticks):  
{r}    
install.packages("ggplot2")   
install.packages("gapminder")_    

 + Still working on having a better understanding of .rmd and the       
        difference with .md files. Are .md just more workable/edittable?
 
        
Still had a great time.
