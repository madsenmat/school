### I THINK ART IS COOL AND LOVE INSTALLATIONS

- I editted everything locally using RStudio and therefore saved, committed and pushed to github.com
    + I found I was going through the github and refreshing alot and commiting alot I feel like I don't understand this process as it was disruptive to my workflow which I can't see pros doing. 

- I had trouble once when I clicked amend but that resolved its self when I closed everything and relaunched. 

Still how I Felt After Completing This....
